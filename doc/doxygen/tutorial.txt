\section warning Warning:

<B>This documentation refers to an API suggested to RtMidi (and available at <a href="https://github.com/keinstein/rtmidi/tree/portdescriptor-api">GitHub</a>). So far it is not officially accepted in the RtMidi distribution.</B>

\section intro Introduction

RtMidi is a set of C++ classes (rtmidi::MidiIn, rtmidi::MidiOut and API-specific classes) that provides a common API (Application Programming Interface) for realtime MIDI input/output across Linux (ALSA & JACK), Macintosh OS X (CoreMIDI & JACK), and Windows (Multimedia Library) operating systems.  RtMidi significantly simplifies the process of interacting with computer MIDI hardware and software.  It was designed with the following goals:
    - object oriented C++ design
    - simple, common API across all supported platforms
    - only one header and one source file for easy inclusion in programming projects
    - query availlable MIDI devices

Where applicable, multiple API support can be compiled and a particular API specified when creating an RtAudio instance.

MIDI input and output functionality are separated into two classes, rtmidi::MidiIn and rtmidi::MidiOut.  Each class instance supports only a single MIDI connection.  RtMidi does not provide timing functionality (i.e., output messages are sent immediately).  Input messages are timestamped with delta times in seconds (via a \c double floating point type).  MIDI data is passed to the user as raw bytes using an std::vector<unsigned char>.

\section whatsnewts What's New in the Fork (Version 5.0)

     - The classes of RtMidi now reside in the namespace rtmidi.
     - The beginning letters “Rt” are dropped from the names
     - For easy adoption of the new interface wrappers for the old API are provided.
     - The library uses backend provided port descriptors, now. This provides a more reliable port handling for changing environments (See below).
     - Allow to use all supported backends in parallel

The way MIDI devices are enumerated has changed. The old way, using the ordinal number of MIDI devices works only in cases where MIDI devices are not added or removed during the program session. When a virtual MIDI port or USB MIDI device is added or removed the ordinal number of each of the other devices may change.

Suppose your computer has the following list of MIDI devices.
    1. MIDI loopback device
    2. Removable USB MIDI device
    3. Another MIDI device
    4. Software MIDI Synth
    5. A virtual MIDI port

After the software obtained this list, your friend remembers that he
must catch the next bus and unplugs his removable USB MIDI device.
The software does not recognize this removal and keeps the above list,
while the system has a new one:
    1. MIDI loopback device
    2. Another MIDI device
    3. Software MIDI Synth
    4. A virtual MIDI port

Somehow you told the software to use the Software MIDI Synth. The
program stores the number 4 as it obtained during enumeration of the
MIDI devices. Instead of playing the music using your sound card it
sends the music to a different port.

While this behaviour is only annoying in interactive environments it
results in unpredictable behaviour if several ports are opened at
once. E.g. in the ALSA backend every opened port results in an
aditional newly created virtual port.

In order to avoid such problems, most backends identify ports (except
WinMM) by different data structures.

The current version introduces a new class \ref rtmidi::PortDescriptor
in order to hide this implementation detail from the user code. In
order to avoid the above problems these are retrieved at once using \ref rtmidi::Midi::getPortList.
This new feature also allows to retreive the port descriptor of an open device using
\ref rtmidi::Midi::getDescriptor. The latter can be used to obtain



\section whatsnew What's New (Version 3.0.0)

The version number has been bumped to 3.0.0 because of the past API change concerning the renaming of the RtError class to RtMidiError.  Changes in this release include:

- see git history for complete list of changes
- new sendMessage() function that does not use std::vector
- various std::string updates, including use of UTF8 for port names
- fixes for the MIDI queue
- various build system updates and code efficiencies

Latest Release (31 August 2017): <A href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/release/rtmidi-3.0.0.tar.gz">Version 3.0.0</A>

\section start Getting Started

The first thing that must be done when using RtMidi is to create an instance of the rtmidi::MidiIn or rtmidi::MidiOut subclasses.  rtmidi::Midi is an abstract base class, which itself cannot be instantiated.  Each default constructor attempts to establish any necessary "connections" with the underlying MIDI system.  RtMidi uses C++ exceptions to report errors, necessitating try/catch blocks around many member functions.  An rtmidi::Error can be thrown during instantiation in some circumstances.  A warning message may also be reported if no MIDI devices are found during instantiation.  The RtMidi classes have been designed to work with "hot pluggable" or virtual (software) MIDI devices, making it possible to connect to MIDI devices that may not have been present when the classes were instantiated.  The following code example demonstrates default object construction and destruction:

\include getting_started.cpp

Obviously, this example doesn't demonstrate any of the real functionality of RtMidi.  However, all uses of RtMidi must begin with construction and must end with class destruction.  Further, it is necessary that all class methods that can throw a C++ exception be called within a try/catch block.

\note The outer try/catch block can be simplyfied if you create the MidiIn object on the stack as it is done in the following examples.




\section error Error Handling

RtMidi uses a C++ exception handler called rtmidi::Error, which is
declared and defined in RtMidi.h.  The rtmidi::Error class is quite
simple but it does allow errors to be "caught" by rtmidi::Error::Type.
Many RtMidi methods can "throw" an rtmidi::Error, most typically if a
driver error occurs or an invalid function argument is specified.
There are a number of cases within RtMidi where warning messages may
be displayed but an exception is not thrown.  A client error callback
function can be specified (via the rtmidi::Midi::setErrorCallback function)
that is invoked when an error occurs. By default, error messages are
not automatically displayed in RtMidi unless the preprocessor
definition __RTMIDI_DEBUG__ is defined during compilation.  Messages
associated with caught exceptions can be displayed with, for example,
the rtmidi::Error::printMessage() function.


\section probing Probing Ports

A client generally must query the available MIDI ports before deciding which to use.  The following example outlines how this can be done. A more sophisticated example demonstrating the API detection and the different naming schemes can be found in the \c tests subdirectory in the file \link midiprobe2.cpp \c midiprobe2.cpp \endlink.

\code
// midiprobe.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <map>
#include "RtMidi.h"

int main()
{
  // Create an api map.
  std::map<int, std::string> apiMap;
  apiMap[RtMidi::MACOSX_CORE] = "OS-X CoreMidi";
  apiMap[RtMidi::WINDOWS_MM] = "Windows MultiMedia";
  apiMap[RtMidi::WINDOWS_KS] = "Windows Kernel Straming";
  apiMap[RtMidi::UNIX_JACK] = "Jack Client";
  apiMap[RtMidi::LINUX_ALSA] = "Linux ALSA";
  apiMap[RtMidi::RTMIDI_DUMMY] = "RtMidi Dummy";

  std::vector< rtmidi::ApiType > apis;
  rtmidi::Midi :: getCompiledApi( apis );

  std::cout << "\nCompiled APIs:\n";
  for ( unsigned int i=0; i<apis.size(); i++ )
    std::cout << "  " << apiMap[ apis[i] ] << std::endl;


  try {

    // rtmidi::MidiIn constructor ... exception possible
    rtmidi::MidiIn midiin;

    std::cout << "\nCurrent input API: " << apiMap[ midiin.getCurrentApi() ] << std::endl;


    rtmidi::PortList list = midiin.getPortList();
    // Check inputs.
    std::cout << "\nThere are " << list.size() << " MIDI input sources available.\n";
    for (rtmidi::PortList::iterator i = list.begin();
	 i != list.end();
	 i++) {
	    std::cout << " Input Port: " << (*i)->getName() << std::endl;
    }

    std::cout << "**********************************************************************" << std::endl;

    // rtmidi::MidiOut constructor ... exception possible
    rtmidi::MidiOut midiout;

    std::cout << "\nCurrent output API: " << apiMap[ midiout.getCurrentApi() ] << std::endl;

    list = midiout.getPortList();

    // Check inputs.
    std::cout << "\nThere are " << list.size() << " MIDI output sinks available.\n";

    for (rtmidi::PortList::iterator i = list.begin();
	 i != list.end();
	 i++) {
	    std::cout << " Output Port: " << (*i)->getName() << std::endl;
    }

  } catch ( rtmidi::Error &error ) {
    error.printMessage();
  }

  return 0;
}
\endcode

\section output MIDI Output

The rtmidi::MidiOut class provides simple functionality to immediately send messages over a MIDI connection.  No timing functionality is provided. Note that there is are overloaded \ref rtmidi::MidiOut::sendMessage() functions for C arrays as well as std::vectors.

In the following example, we omit necessary error checking and details regarding OS-dependent sleep functions.  For a complete example, see the \link midiout2.cpp \c midiout2.cpp \endlink program in the \c tests directory.

\code
// midiout.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include "RtMidi.h"

int main()
{
  try {
    rtmidi::MidiOut midiout;
    std::vector<unsigned char> message;

    // Check available ports.
    rtmidi::PortList list = midiout.getPortList();
    if (list.empty()) {
       std::cerr << "No devices found." << std::endl;
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Open first available port.
    midiout.openPort( list.front );

    // Send out a series of MIDI messages.

    // Program change: 192, 5
    message.push_back( 192 );
    message.push_back( 5 );
    midiout.sendMessage( &message );

    // Control Change: 176, 7, 100 (volume)
    message[0] = 176;
    message[1] = 7;
    message.push_back( 100 );
    midiout.sendMessage( &message );

    // Note On: 144, 64, 90
    message[0] = 144;
    message[1] = 64;
    message[2] = 90;
    midiout.sendMessage( &message );

    SLEEP( 500 ); // Platform-dependent ... see example in tests directory.

    // Note Off: 128, 64, 40
    message[0] = 128;
    message[1] = 64;
    message[2] = 40;
    midiout.sendMessage( &message );

  } catch (rtmidi::Error & error) {
    error.printMessage();
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
  return 0;
}
\endcode


\section input MIDI Input

The rtmidi::MidiIn class uses an internal callback function or thread to receive incoming MIDI messages from a port or device.  These messages are then either queued and read by the user via calls to the rtmidi::MidiIn::getMessage() function or immediately passed to a user-specified callback function (which must be "registered" using the rtmidi::MidiIn::setCallback() function).  We'll provide examples of both usages.

The rtmidi::MidiIn class provides the rtmidi::MidiIn::ignoreTypes() function to specify that certain MIDI message types be ignored.  By default, system exclusive, timing, and active sensing messages are ignored.

\subsection qmidiin Queued MIDI Input

The rtmidi::MidiIn::getMessage() function does not block.  If a MIDI message is available in the queue, it is copied to the user-provided \c std::vector<unsigned char> container.  When no MIDI message is available, the function returns an empty container.  The default maximum MIDI queue size is 1024 messages.  This value may be modified with the rtmidi::MidiIn::setQueueSizeLimit() function.  If the maximum queue size limit is reached, subsequent incoming MIDI messages are discarded until the queue size is reduced.

In the following example, we omit some necessary error checking and details regarding OS-dependent sleep functions.  For a more complete example, see the \link qmidiin2.cpp \c qmidiin2.cpp \endlink program in the \c tests directory.

\code
// qmidiin.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <signal.h>
#include "RtMidi.h"

bool done;
static void finish(int ignore){ done = true; }

int main()
{
  try {
    rtmidi::MidiIn midiin;
    std::vector<unsigned char> message;
    int nBytes, i;
    double stamp;

    // Check available ports.
    rtmidi::PortList list = midiin.getPortList();
    if (list.empty()) {
       std::cerr << "No devices found." << std::endl;
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Open first available port.
    midiin.openPort( list.front );

    // Don't ignore sysex, timing, or active sensing messages.
    midiin.ignoreTypes( false, false, false );

    // Install an interrupt handler function.
    done = false;
    (void) signal(SIGINT, finish);

    // Periodically check input queue.
    std::cout << "Reading MIDI from port ... quit with Ctrl-C.\n";
    while ( !done ) {
      stamp = midiin.getMessage( &message );
      nBytes = message.size();
      for ( i=0; i<nBytes; i++ )
        std::cout << "Byte " << i << " = " << (int)message[i] << ", ";
      if ( nBytes > 0 )
        std::cout << "stamp = " << stamp << std::endl;

      // Sleep for 10 milliseconds ... platform-dependent.
      SLEEP( 10 );
    }

  } catch (rtmidi::Error & error) {
    error.printMessage();
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
  return 0;
}
\endcode

\subsection cmidiin MIDI Input with User Callback

When set, a user-provided callback function will be invoked after the input of a complete MIDI message.  It is possible to provide a pointer to user data that can be accessed in the callback function (not shown here).  It is necessary to set the callback function immediately after opening the port to avoid having incoming messages written to the queue (which is not emptied when a callback function is set).  If you are worried about this happening, you can check the queue using the rtmidi::Midi::getMessage() function to verify it is empty (after the callback function is set).

In the following example, we omit some necessary error checking.  For a more complete example, see the \c cmidiin.cpp program in the \c tests directory.

\code
// cmidiin.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include "RtMidi.h"

void mycallback( double deltatime, std::vector< unsigned char > *message, void *userData )
{
  unsigned int nBytes = message->size();
  for ( unsigned int i=0; i<nBytes; i++ )
    std::cout << "Byte " << i << " = " << (int)message->at(i) << ", ";
  if ( nBytes > 0 )
    std::cout << "stamp = " << deltatime << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
  try {
    rtmidi::MidiIn midiin;

    // Check available ports.
    rtmidi::PortList list = midiin.getPortList();
    if (list.empty()) {
       std::cerr << "No ports available." << std::endl;
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Open first available port.
    midiin.openPort( list.front );

    // Set our callback function.  This should be done immediately after
    // opening the port to avoid having incoming messages written to the
    // queue.
    midiin.setCallback( &mycallback );

    // Don't ignore sysex, timing, or active sensing messages.
    midiin.ignoreTypes( false, false, false );

    std::cout << "\nReading MIDI input ... press <enter> to quit.\n";
    char input;
    std::cin.get(input);

  } catch (rtmidi::Error & error) {
    error.printMessage();
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
  return 0;
}
\endcode

\section virtual Virtual Ports

The Linux ALSA, Macintosh CoreMIDI and JACK APIs allow for the establishment of virtual input and output MIDI ports to which other software clients can connect.  RtMidi incorporates this functionality with the rtmidi::MidiIn::openVirtualPort() and rtmidi::MidiOut::openVirtualPort() functions.  Any messages sent with the rtmidi::MidiOut::sendMessage() function will also be transmitted through an open virtual output port.  If a virtual input port is open and a user callback function is set, the callback function will be invoked when messages arrive via that port.  If a callback function is not set, the user must poll the input queue to check whether messages have arrived.  No notification is provided for the establishment of a client connection via a virtual port. The RtMidi::isPortOpen() function does not report the status of ports created with the RtMidi::openVirtualPort() function.

\section compiling Compiling

In order to compile RtMidi for a specific OS and API, it is necessary to supply the appropriate preprocessor definition and library within the compiler statement:

\section debug Debugging

If you are having problems getting RtMidi to run on your system, try passing the preprocessor definition <TT>__RTMIDI_DEBUG__</TT> to the compiler (or define it in RtMidi.h).  A variety of warning messages will be displayed that may help in determining the problem.  Also try using the programs included in the <tt>tests</tt> directory.  The program <tt>midiprobe</tt> displays the queried capabilities of all MIDI ports found.

\section multi Using Simultaneous Multiple APIs

Support for each MIDI API is encapsulated in specific \ref rtmidi::MidiInApi or \ref rtmidi::MidiOutApi subclasses, making it possible to compile and instantiate multiple API-specific subclasses on a given operating system.  For example, one can compile both CoreMIDI and JACK support on the OS-X operating system by providing the appropriate preprocessor definitions for each.  In a run-time situation, one might first attempt to determine whether any JACK ports are available.  This can be done by specifying the api argument rtmidi::UNIX_JACK when attempting to create an instance of rtmidi::MidiIn or rtmidi::MidiOut.  If no available ports are found, then an instance of rtmidi::Midi with the api argument rtmidi::MACOSX_CORE can be created.  Alternately, if no api argument is specified, RtMidi will first look for OS provided ports and if none are found, then software demons (currently JACK) ports (in linux, the search order is ALSA and then JACK).

It is also possible to use all compiled backends simultaneously by passing the special api argument rtmidi::ALL_API to the constructor. In that case rtmidi::midi::getPortList will return a list of all port descriptors from all backends that are available. On the other hand rtmidi::midi::openVirtualPort will open only one port on the first API that is tested in the automatic port selecton as described above.

The static function rtmidi::Midi::getCompiledApi() is provided to determine the available compiled API support.  The function rtmidi::Midi::getCurrentApi() indicates the API selected for a given RtMidi instance.

\note It is recommended to avoid the atomatic API selection for virtual ports. In most cases it is a better option to let the end user choose the API for this port or simply generate an array of ports, each with a different backend API.

\section apinotes API Notes

RtMidi is designed to provide a common API across the various supported operating systems and audio libraries.  Despite that, some issues should be mentioned with regard to each.

\subsection linux Linux:

Two different MIDI APIs are supported on Linux platforms: <A href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</A> and <A href="http://jackit.sourceforge.net/">JACK</A>. A decision was made to not include support for the OSS API because the OSS API provides very limited functionality and because <A href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</A> support is incorporated in the Linux kernel.  The ALSA sequencer and JACK APIs allows for virtual software input and output ports.

\subsection macosx Macintosh OS X (CoreAudio):

The Apple CoreMIDI API allows for the establishment of virtual input and output ports to which other software applications can connect.

The RtMidi JACK support can be compiled on Macintosh OS-X systems, as well as in Linux.

\subsection windowsds Windows (Multimedia Library):

The \c configure script provides support for the MinGW compiler.

The Windows Multimedia library MIDI calls used in RtMidi do not make use of streaming functionality.   Incoming system exclusive messages read by rtimidi::MidiIn are limited to a length as defined by the preprocessor definition RT_SYSEX_BUFFER_SIZE (set in RtMidi.cpp).  The default value is 1024.  There is no such limit for outgoing sysex messages via rtmidi::MidiOut.

RtMidi was originally developed with Visual C++ version 6.0 but has been tested with Virtual Studio 2010.
