This distribution of RtMidi contains the following:

doc:      RtMidi documentation (see doc/html/index.html)
tests:    example RtMidi programs

On unix systems, type "./configure" in the top level directory, then "make" in the tests/ directory to compile the test programs.  In Windows, open the Visual C++ workspace file located in the tests/ directory.

If you checked out the code from git, please run "autoconf" before "./configure".

OVERVIEW:

RtMidi is a set of C++ classes (RtMidiIn, RtMidiOut, and API specific classes) that provide a common API (Application Programming Interface) for realtime MIDI input/output across Linux (ALSA, Jack), Macintosh OS X (CoreMidi, Jack), SGI, and Windows (Multimedia Library, Kernel Streming) operating systems.  RtMidi significantly simplifies the process of interacting with computer MIDI hardware and software.  It was designed with the following goals:

  - object oriented C++ design
  - simple, common API across all supported platforms
  - only two header files and one source file for easy inclusion in programming projects
  - MIDI device enumeration

MIDI input and output functionality are separated into two classes, RtMidiIn and RtMidiOut.  Each class instance supports only a single MIDI connection.  RtMidi does not provide timing functionality (i.e., output messages are sent immediately).  Input messages are timestamped with delta times in seconds (via a double floating point type).  MIDI data is passed to the user as raw bytes using an std::vector<unsigned char>.
